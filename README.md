Asset files for Motschen's Better Leaves resourcepack, making the Eastward Journeys mod compatible.

To use these assets, navigate to your resourcepack for Motschen's Better Leaves and pop the eastwardjourneys folder into the assets directory.

Example from your .minecraft folder: resourcepacks > Better-Leaves-X.X-X.XX+ > assets

Then turn on the resourcepack when you launch Minecraft and all of the Eastward Journeys new leaves blocks should now be using the models from the Better Leaves resourcepack!
